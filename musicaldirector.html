                <h3>Working as a Musical Director</h3>
            <p> I have been a working musical director in New York City for decades. I MD'd 12 consecutive Broadway Junior shows for Kids Company at the West Side YMCA, was the music specialist for 6 summers for West Side YMCA's Arts Camp, and I teach musical theater in the drama department at the famed Laguardia High School for the Performing Arts.
